# Building Blocks

This section enumerates through the basic elements of Rook. These building blocks have a lot flexibility in how they come together which can make each game widely different from one another. To make this a little more understandable, we'll touch on the more common ways the game unfolds.

## Players

Like most other games, Rook is about the players. Games can have anywhere from two to potentially hundreds of players. The game also accomodates for a range of cooperative levels. Players can choose to go lone wolf, team up into small groups, or amass into large conglomerates. Each player owns a set of carefully picked assets that they bring with them to the game and that they believe will give them an edge. These assets are a mixture of settlements and traits.

## Factions

Rook can be viewed as a last-faction-standing game whereby factions, which are made from one or more players, compete to outlast and topple one another. When factions merge, both traits and settlements also merge together.

## Resources

Each faction gains and loses dominance in a game by their ability to manage a set of resources. There are three natural resources: food, stone, and wood as well as a fourth human-made resource called technology. Acquiring these resources enables the production of settlements and the unlocking of traits.

## Settlements

Factions can use their resources to build settlements. Each settlement offers their own set of advantages. Farms produce food, Lumbermills harvest wood, Towns increase population and Universities unlock technologies. Settlements can be divided into two types: Common and Rare. All players have access to the common set of settlements. Rare settlements are fixed in number and must be won, discovered, bought or stolen. The most important settlement of all is the "Capital". All games start with each faction having a Capital. Capturing an opponents Capital will cause them to merge into your faction. Sacking an opponents Capital will defeat them.

## Traits

Traits are rules that are applied faction-wide. They can be enabled either through the consumption of technology or simply by discovery. One example of a trait is "Fortification" which doubles the population within every city and capital.

## Map

The game is played on a 2D rectangular grid of tiles which make up a map. Each tile is one of four possible terrains: Mountains, Forest, Seas and Plains. Both Mountains and Seas are impassable terrain. Maps can largely vary in size to accomodate the amount of players participating.

## Population

The atomic unit of every faction is its population. Population can move freely around the map so long as it's not through mountains or seas. Unless paired with a trait, populaces move one tile per step. Population can be used to defend and capture settlements. Populations can also be split up and merged simply by moving two Populace together on the same tile.

## Step-based

The entire flow of the game is broken down in discrete steps. Note that it is not exactly turn-based. All factions make their moves at the same time. Each step will usually be around 3-5 seconds. In that time a Faction is allowed to move each populace by one step or to build a settlement at the location of the populace.

## Gaia and Relics

There are many more subtle oddities about the game. One such oddity is that maps can be pre-filled with existing settlements that belong to no players at all but rather a static faction known as Gaia. Factions that explore quickly can capture these abandoned settlements and use them to their advantage. Relics are small chests that can sometimes be found in a map. Relics can be one of three kind: a victory relic, a cultural relic, or a mystery relic. Capturing all the victory relics in a game is another way of winning. Cultural relics give the possessing faction a particular trait. Mystery relics are by far the rarest and allow grant the possessing faction a mysterious asset.
