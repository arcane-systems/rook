# Welcome to Rook

**What is Rook?**

**Rook** is a decentralized multiplayer strategy game akin to Age of Empires where the objective is to build up a civilization and compete against opposing factions. The game has both competitive and cooperative components to it. Each game is designed to be short, around 10 minutes in length depending on the size of the map and the amount of participants. Each player starts the game with a single settlement, the capital and a combination of resources: food, stone, and wood. The capital, like other settlements produces population. Population units can move around the map, in a step-based fashion, building other settlements using the accumulated resources and overcoming opposing populations if there are more units then the opponent. Players can capture one anothers settlements and benefit from the advantages that that settlement brings.

The objective of the game is to try to either capture or sack all the capitals of an opponent. Capturing a capital will result in the two factions combining. This introduces the collaborative part of the game. Now both players have full control of the faction and must work together to overcome the rest of the teams and be the last one remaining.

Outside of the game itself, players accumulate a set of unique items: a mixture of traits and settlements. These items, represented as NFT's can be found in game, won off opponents or traded at the marketplace. Winners of games earn tokens as part of the block rewards. Games can be played with varying levels of stakes to make it interesting or over tournaments. To read more, dive into the [game rules](../rules/overview.md).
