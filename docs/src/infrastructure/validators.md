# Validators

Validators are the participants of the consensus engine, agreeing on the state transitions of  games as well as any other transaction that gets submitted to the network. Nodes can become validators by staking ROOK tokens. Voting power in the network is decided based on the amount of tokens that validators and delegators put at stake. As a reward for securing the network, all validators and delegators get rewarded with ROOK tokens.

In order to run a validator, first follow the instructions of setting up a [node](./nodes.md)
